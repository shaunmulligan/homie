# Golang example project on Raspberry Pi 3 with Resin.io

A small resin.io boilerplate project to show how to develop quickly with the Go language.
This example shows you how to use `resin sync` to quickly sync and testing a cross-compiled golang binary to a single device before releasing the whole App/fleet of devices.

## Prerequisites
To use this boilerplate effectively you will need the following installed on your dev laptop.
* at least go version `go1.6.2 darwin/amd64`, cross compilation is earlier versions is much more difficult
* [Resin.io CLI](http://docs.resin.io/tools/cli/)
* git

## Usage

1. First clone this repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/shaunmulligan/resin-go-boilerplate.git
```
2. Set your GOPATH as this repo:
```
$ export GOPATH=$PWD
```
3. Change into the repo, add your resin.io application git remote and push.
```
$ cd resin-go-boilerplate
$ git remote add resin shaun@git.resin.io:shaun/myfleet.git
$ git push resin master
```
After the build completes you should see a friendly unicorn on your console and the device should start downloading the new container. When the container starts you should see `hello` and `world` printed multiple times

3. Now change a line in the main.go and run resin sync with the devices UUID as a parameter.
```
$ resin sync <UUID>
```
You should see something like this:
```
resin:goapp hobochild$ resin sync 598e029

```
And your new code should be running on the device in about 30 seconds. Whenever you are happy with a version of your code and it looks like it is working, just commit and push. Now all your devices should be running the newest code you pushed. You will also need to do this if you install any external dependencies for your golang project like `dbus` or something.
